 * Task 4: Normalization
 *
 * a) Write a function min that takes vector of floats as an
 * input and returns a minimal value found.
 * b) Same as above, but a function named max returning the
 * greatest value.
 * c) Write a function Normalize taking a vector as an input
 * and normalizes each element using the following formula:
 *         z_i = (z_i - min(z)) / (max(z) - min(z))
 * where z is the vector accepted as a parameter, and z_i
 * is an ith element of the vector.
